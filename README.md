Great practice instead of leetcode for someone who has too much time

I would like to thank Jonathon Paulson and anthonywritescode for their very helpful solutions when I couldn't solve the problems :DD
* Also credit to Peedee for the first few days, your solutions were really elegant at times and much better cleaned up than mine!

I needed solutions on:
* day 16, day 19, day 22
and maybe more I'm forgetting about, but notice these days may have aspects of the above code written in it.

Hope you have fun reading my really really really inefficient solutions :') trying to get better
